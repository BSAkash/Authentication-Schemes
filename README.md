# Cryptography_Authentication_Scheme
A robust authentication scheme is developed for multiple servers architecture based on cryptography. PyCrypto libraries are used for the development of this project. This is the implementation of the IEEE paper [Wang, Huawei, Dianli Guo, Qiaoyan Wen, and Hua Zhang. "A Robust Authentication Scheme for Multiple Servers Architecture." IEEE Access 7 (2019): 111222-111231](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8782620)
